# Temperature-monitoring-system.

This project uses a temperature sensor, an OLED display, red and green LEDs, and a DC motor. The basic function is to display the temperature on the OLED display and monitor it. If it exceeds a given temperature, then the fan connected to the DC motor is turned on, plus an LED to indicate the change in temperature is turned on.

The temperature is monitored and displayed using a DHT11 sensor.

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and outputs a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). Itâ€™s fairly simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data1.
