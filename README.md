# Temperature-monitoring-system.

This project uses a temp. sensor , an oled display , red and green LEDs, a dc motor.the basic function is to display the temperature on the OLED display and monitor it , if it exceeds a given temperature then the fan connected to the DC motor is turned on plus a LED to indicate the change in temperatue is turned on. 

temperature is monitored and displayed using LM35 sensor.

LM35 is an integrated analog temperature sensor whose electrical output is proportional to Degree Centigrade. LM35 Sensor does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies. The LM35â€™s low output impedance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration make interfacing to readout or control circuitry especially easy.
